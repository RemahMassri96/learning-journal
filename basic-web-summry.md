# HTML (Summary)
structure is very important in helping readers to understand the message you trying to convey.
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value
- Attributes provide additional information about the content of the element.
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
 - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
 - The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements). 
- Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
 - Why People Visit
YOUR Website
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
