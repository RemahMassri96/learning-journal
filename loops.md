# Comparison and logical operators :
You can evalute a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect 
it might be.
The result will be a boolean 
- true 
- false 

- `===` : (Equal to) this operator comaparse two values to see if they are the same
- `!==` : (is not equal to) this operator compares two values to see if they not the same 
- `>`   : (greater than ) operator checks if the number on left is greater than the number on right 
- `<`   : (less than) operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on right 
- `>=` : (greater than or equal ) this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right 
- `<=` : (less than or equal) this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on right 

## Logical operators :
Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparsion operator 
 
 - `&&` : This operator test more than one condition 
 - `||` : This operator test at least one condition 
 - `!`  :  This operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it .

 ** Loops : ** 
 Loops check a condition. if it return ** true ** a code block will run , then the condition will be checked again and if it still return ** true ** it repates untill the condition return ** false ** 

 There are three common types of loops :
 1.  for  :
 if you need to run a code a specfic number of time 

 2.  while  :
 if you don't know how many times the code should run 
 
 3.  do .. while 
 the do .. while loop is very similar to while loop but has one key differance it will run always run the statments inside the curly praces at least one  even the condition evalutes to false.
