# Text Editor :
A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs). Typically, a text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers. You can then fill the lines in with text, line by line. A special command line lets you move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions

## Picking an IDE: 
The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer. so becuse of that will be carefull when you choose your IDE!

### What to look for in a Code Editor :
All code editors can write text and save it to a file. Beyond that, the type of editor you choose is purely down to your personal preference. 
there are a few things that your editor must have for it to be considered good enough for development.
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. themes
4. extensions
5. A debugger. A debugger will try to automatically find and sometimes fix bugs in code for you.

### Examples of text editor
- visual studio code 
- sublime text editor 
- php storm 
 I advice you to take a look on them and pick what you like!
 for me i like [phpstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
 
 # Terminal:
 Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), allow you to to accomplish daily tasks by interacting with windows and icons, and are helpful for many tasks. However, for many tasks, we are better off entering text commands into the computer directly for more efficiency and flexibility. We usually do this through terminals.
 ### Some Terminal Commands ( for basic Navigation) :
 - `~` Indicates the home directory
 - `pwd`  Print working directory (pwd) displays the path name of the current directory
- `cd`  Change Directory
- `mkdir` Make a new directory / file folder
- `..`   Go up one level / directory
- `cd ~`  Return to home directory
- `clear`  Clears information on the display screen to provide a blank slate
 - `ls`  List provides a list of all files with a directory
 
 # Files!
 everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.
 - `file` : obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
 - `ls -a` : List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
 
 ### Linux is an Extensionless System
 A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of      file it is. The following are common extensions:
 - file.exe - an executable file, or program.
 - file.txt - a plain text file.
 - file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
