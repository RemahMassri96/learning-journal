# Text Editor :
A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs). Typically, a text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers. You can then fill the lines in with text, line by line. A special command line lets you move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions

## Picking an IDE: 
The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer. so becuse of that will be carefull when you choose your IDE!

### What to look for in a Code Editor :
All code editors can write text and save it to a file. Beyond that, the type of editor you choose is purely down to your personal preference. 
there are a few things that your editor must have for it to be considered good enough for development.
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. themes
4. extensions
5. A debugger. A debugger will try to automatically find and sometimes fix bugs in code for you.
